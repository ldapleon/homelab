# üè† Homelab

# Introduction

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun. 

Since I startet tinkering with different Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Alpine and Alma in a Virtualbox environment on my local Windows machine, I decided to get refurbished mini-PC's to built a bare-metal homelab in my appartment. First I startet out with a Proxmox cluster where I ran multiple services like Pi-hole, Portainer, Nginx Proxy Manager or Vaultwarden on VMs and LXC-containers.



## Hardware

At the moment my cluster consists of the following components:

HP Prodesk 400 G3 mini (i3 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 256 SSD)

Lenovo ThinkCentre M265q (amd A59120, 16 GB RAM, 256 SSD)
